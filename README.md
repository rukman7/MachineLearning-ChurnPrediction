# Machine Learning: Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is located in the `/orig` directory.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains information about credit card customers and their churn status. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, as well as build a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn.

## Project Details

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The dataset was thoroughly examined to gain insights into the customer churn behavior and understand the characteristics of customers who churned.

2. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning models were explored and evaluated to determine the best-performing model for predicting customer churn. The models considered include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The selected model was evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal was to assess how well the model predicts customer churn.

4. **Model Optimization**: The chosen model was further optimized by tuning hyperparameters and employing techniques such as cross-validation and feature selection to improve its predictive performance.

5. **Predictive Analysis**: The final optimized model was used to make predictions on new, unseen data to forecast customer churn. The predictions can help businesses identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and prediction process, follow these steps:

1. Access the dataset: The dataset can be found in the `/orig` directory.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and gain insights into customer churn behavior.

4. Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Compare the performance of different models and select the best one for further analysis.

5. Model Optimization: Fine-tune the selected model by adjusting hyperparameters, applying feature selection techniques, and validating the model's performance using cross-validation.

6. Prediction: Apply the optimized model to new, unseen data to predict customer churn. Utilize the predictions to take proactive actions and improve customer retention strategies.

## Conclusion

By analyzing and predicting customer churn, businesses can proactively identify customers who are likely to churn and take appropriate actions to retain them. This project provides insights into customer churn behavior and presents a predictive model that can assist in making informed decisions to minimize customer churn and maximize customer satisfaction.
